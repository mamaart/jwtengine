# 🛡️ JWT engine

JWT engine is a library to issue and validate jwt tokens based on asynchronous keypairs, this makes it possible for other services to use the public key provided by an issuer to validate jwt tokens issuded by that issuer.

## TODO

- [ ] Use ED25519 or ECDSA for signing
- [ ] Make http example independent of port number
